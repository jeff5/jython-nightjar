Welcome to Jython 2.7b2
=======================

This is the second beta release of the 2.7 version of Jython. Thanks to
Adconion Media Group (http://www.adconion.com/) for sponsoring this release.
Thanks to all who contribute to Jython.

Jython 2.7b2 brings us up to language level compatibility with the 2.7 version
of CPython. We have focused largely on CPython compatibility, and so this
release of Jython can run more pure Python apps then any previous release.
Please see the NEWS file for detailed release notes. This is primarily a bugfix
release, with numerous improvements, including much improvement on Windows
support.

As a beta release we are concentrating on bug fixing and stabilizion for a
production release.

Please see the NEWS file for detailed release notes.

The release was compiled on OSXX with JDK 7 and requires JDK 7 to run.

Please try this out and report any bugs at http://bugs.jython.org.
