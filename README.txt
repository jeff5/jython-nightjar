Welcome to Jython 2.7b3
=======================

This is the third beta release of the 2.7 version of Jython. Thanks to
Rackspace (http://www.rackspace.com/) for sponsoring this release.
Thanks to all who contribute to Jython.

Jython 2.7b3 includes a total rework of ssl which will soon allow pip to work
on Jython (once pip gets a bugfix as well). It also fixes many bugs including
some in binascii support, ast support, and many others.

As a beta release we are concentrating on bug fixing and stabilizion for a
production release.

Please see the NEWS file for detailed release notes.

The release was compiled on OSX with JDK 7 and requires JDK 7 to run.
