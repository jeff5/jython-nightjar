Jython: Python for the Java Platform

Welcome to Jython 2.7rc3!

This is the third release candidate of the 2.7 version of
Jython. Along with language and runtime compatibility with CPython
2.7, Jython 2.7rc3 provides substantial support of the Python
ecosystem. This includes built-in support of pip/setuptools (start
with bin/pip) and a native launcher for Windows (bin/jython.exe) means
that you can install scripts.

Jim Baker presented a talk at PyCon 2015 about Jython 2.7, including
demos of new features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLm3garVQFo

The release was compiled on OSX using JDK 7 and requires a minimum of
Java 7 to run.
